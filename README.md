## Background

In the wake of Covid-19, virtually all high school students around the world have been forced to study from home due to the government-imposed lockdowns. Our team is interested in keeping high schoolers engaged in their studies in a fun way by creating a digital product (desktop or mobile app) to allow them to interact with their peers through educational subject/topic-based chatrooms. Since many high schoolers around the world are not going to school at the moment, our platform aims to be easily accessible online 24 hours a day as well as equipped with subject-based chatrooms to make it easy for the student to find the relevant chatroom they are looking for when studying a particular subject.

## Research Goal

Our team wants to learn about how high schoolers use digital products to augment their learning experience at school as well as how they engage with popular chat-based applications. We want to determine what opportunities and needs might exist for new educational chat-based products so that we can use these findings to help us shape the direction we take in developing our product.
